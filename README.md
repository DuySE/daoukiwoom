# Assignment for FrontEnd Genius

## The task
Your task is about to create a Javascript application (ReactJS) that serves the
Authentication feature.

### Assumptions
We have already the API for login:
[GET] https://6164054db55edc00175c1cc9.mockapi.io/v1/auth/1

### Requirements
As a developer, I want to have Authentication page with the APIs on the Assumptions

The UI/UX will follow the Figma Design as follows:
https://www.figma.com/file/lcaAmn0buEb5gT2Vt2bXim/Kairos-Project?node-id=0%3A1

The login screen can be created whatever you want.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
